  "Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition!": {

    "analysis": "A linguistic storm that establishes V’s theatricality and mission in one breath. He casts himself as victim and villain, blurring moral lines while turning language into performance. The dense alliteration is not just style — it asserts control, overwhelming the listener while declaring rebellion as an art form.",
